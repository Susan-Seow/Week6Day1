# Week6Day1
First attempt at writing JQuery code to change attribute in website, have to turn project in at this point.
Ran into several limitation with current level of learning.
I was not able to change text in product card to distribute evenly, even with adding flex-wrap and flex:1 in css style sheets.
I was not able to change body to black during dark mode even though I tried writing code in both CSS and JS sheet. 
I was not able to delete the website display of In-Stock.
Solid First effort.
